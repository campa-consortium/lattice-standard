Please remove any sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) from your submission.
Please fill in the details for all of the relevant items below.
Thank you for taking the time to complete this PR.  It will be reviewed as soon as possible.

## Element name
Provide a proposed name for the lattice element.  This can be an abbreviation, and should be at most 1-2 words (e.g., Quadrupole).

## Element description
Provide a brief description of the lattice element.  Please include:
- A clear and concise description of the element (1-2 sentences)
- How the element is typically used (e.g., class of accelerator, beam dynamics purpose)

## List of element parameters
Provide a bulleted list of the element parameters.  For each parameter, include:
- a short symbol to denote the parameter
- type of the parameter (integer, float, array of float, etc.)
- physical units of the parameter
- a brief phrase describing the parameter

## Physical model
Provide a well-defined mathematical description of the element and its parameters.  This may include equations, figures, etc.  
This description should completely specify the element in an unambiguous form, and may include one of the following:
- equations describing the physical geometry
- equations describing the electromagnetic fields
- equations describing the dynamical transfer map

## Alternative descriptions
If applicable, provide a description of similar widely-used elements or alternative parameter sets.
The purpose is to provide disambiguation and to provide criteria that may be used to aid in classification and grouping.

## Additional information
If applicable, please provide any additional information that may be relevant, such as:
- Links to existing codes or implementations
- Any relevant technical requirements or specifications
- References to relevant publications or research
